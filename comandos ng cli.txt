//An Angular best practice is to load and configure the router in a separate, top-level module that is dedicated to routing and imported by the root AppModule.
//By convention, the module class name is AppRoutingModule and it belongs in the app-routing.module.ts in the src/app folder.
// --flat puts the file in src/app instead of its own folder.
// --module=app tells the CLI to register it in the imports array of the AppModule.
